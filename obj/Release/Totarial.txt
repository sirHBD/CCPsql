TUTORIAL												

1.	GENERAL INTRODUCTION											
												
	So much of  the success  of  a  business  has to  do with  MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION  for the business. Making these											
	decisions  effectively   are  very  difficult  unless  one  has   INFORMATION  at  hand.  This  information  will  vary  from  the 											
	financial  results  of   the  business   to  information  on   product costs  and  prices  to  "softer"  issues  such  as customer											
	satisfaction and staff  attitudes.											
												
	Most  of  us  who  have  been  in  business  for  a  while  will  instinctively  recognize  the  importance  of  phrases  such as											
	'the customer is  king'  and/or  'look after  your staff  and   they  will  look  after  your  business'.   As  important  as  those 											
	are  to  any  business,  this  tutorial  does  not  deal  with  them. Rather,  this  tutorial   addresses  the  very  foundation  of											
	any  business;  the  relationship  of  the  COSTS  of  the  business  with  the  SALES  of  the  business. 											
												
	This tutorial  addresses  the  GROSS PROFIT of  a  business;  WHAT  it  is,  WHY  it  is important,  HOW  it  is calculated											
	and HOW  it links  with the  FIXED OVERHEAD  of your  business to either  ensure the  SUCCESS  or cause the FAILURE											
	of your business. Without  this  vital  INFORMATION,  you  will  not  be  able  to  structure  your  business  effectively.											
												
	This  tutorial   will  not  only  stress  the  importance  of  managing  the  GROSS PROFIT  and  FIXED OVERHEAD  of your 											
	business   continuously,   but  will   also   teach  you   how  to  use    the  COSTING PROGRAM   to  which  this  tutorial is											
	attached,  in order that you become a  BUSINESS CHAMPION  by first becoming  a  GROSS PROFIT CHAMPION.											
												
2.	GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GROSS PROFIT											
												
	2.1	INTRODUCTION TO GROSS PROFIT										
												
		2.1.1	In  the   larger   (macro)  sense  of   your  business,   the   GROSS PROFIT  is   the  difference  between  the									
			SALES  the business achieved and  the  DIRECT COSTS  the business incurred in  achieving those  SALES.									
												
		2.1.2	In  the   smaller  (micro)  sense  of  your  business,   the   GROSS PROFIT  is  the  difference  between what									
			your  business   SELLS  each   PRODUCT  for  and  what  it  COSTS   you to  produce  that   PRODUCT.									
												
		2.1.3	When  you  multiply  the  VOLUMES  of   each  product  sold   by  the  differences  between  their  respective									
			PRODUCT SELLING PRICES   and  DIRECT PRODUCT COSTS,  you  get  back   to  the  business'  overall									
			SALES and DIRECT COSTS and the difference  is  the  overall   GROSS PROFIT  of  the  business.									
												
	2.2	WHERE DOES GROSS PROFIT FIT IN?										
												
		2.2.1	First  of  all,  PROFIT,  and  hopefully  a  lot  of  it, is  important. Why  else  will  we  want  to be in business?									
												
			But  PROFIT,  or  NET PROFIT,   only  comes  at   the  end  of  the  line,  after  a  lot of  hard  work has been									
			done  and  a LOT of  COST  has  been  incurred  to  generate  the  SALES  which  will hopefully  deliver some									
			PROFIT.  The  COSTS  your  business   have  incurred   along   the  way  can  basically  be  broken  up  into									
			TWO broad categories : DIRECT COST and OVERHEAD.									
												
		2.2.2	If we put the above together, the structure looks as follows:									
												
				SALES								
			Less:	DIRECT COST								
			Equals:	GROSS PROFIT								
			Less:	OVERHEAD								
			Equals:	NET PROFIT								
												
		2.2.3	An example is:									
												
				SALES		R 100		100%				
			Less:	DIRECT COST		R 60		60%				
			Equals:	GROSS PROFIT		R 40		40%		<-GROSS PROFIT %		
			Less:	OVERHEAD		R 20		20%				
			Equals:	NET PROFIT		R 20		20%				
												
			In  the  above  business,    DIRECT COST of R60   was incurred  to produce  SALES of R100.  This produced									
			a  GROSS PROFIT  of  R40.  The  GROSS PROFIT  was  then  further  reduced  by  the  FIXED OVERHEAD									
			of  R20  to  finally produce  a  NET PROFIT  of  R20.									
												
			We  will  later  have  a  look  at  how  different  these  structures  can  be  and  how  clearly  these  structures									
			reflect  the  health of any business.

	2.3	WHY IS GROSS PROFIT SO IMPORTANT?										
												
		2.3.1	GROSS  PROFIT  occupies  the  CENTER   of  the  above  equation   because   it  is  the  "BREADBASKET"									
			of  any  business  operation.  It  is,   on  the  one  hand,  the  result  of   SALES  LESS  DIRECT  COST  (you									
			can  also  call  it   WHAT  YOU  HAVE  LEFT  OF YOUR  SALES   after  you  have  paid  for  the  things  and									
			the  people  which   PRODUCE  it in   the  first   place)  and  it ,  on   the  other  hand,  has  the  responsibility									
			of covering the OVERHEAD  of your business. 
			
		2.3.2	How  often  have  you  taken  on  business  when  you  knew  the  PRICE  you  were  getting  for  the
			work required  is  simply  NOT  ENOUGH? That almost  instinctive  feeling  is  based  on GROSS PROFIT,
			in these cases, not making enough gross profit.
			
		2.3.3	How  often   have   you   taken  on  an  order,  knowing   that  it  was   going  to   lose  you   money?
			That  feeling  is, again,  based on  an almost  instinctive knowledge  about  the principle  of  GROSS PROFIT.
			
		2.3.4	In  spite of  this almost  instinctive  knowledge,  many businesses  will  continue   to take  on  "negative-G.P."
			work.  This  is  largely  so  because   most  businesses   will  willingly  chase  TURNOVER (SALES),  at  the
			expense of  PROFIT.   BUT, SALES  do not  create success;  PROFIT does.  SALES do not  create financial
			stability;  PROFIT does.  SALES  do not create  CASH;  PROFIT does. So why  then do  we  hunt sales. We
			should  be  hunting  PROFIT.  That  is  the  importance  of  GROSS PROFIT;  at  the  barest  minimum,  it  is
			the  FIRST  STEP  to  OVERALL  PROFIT
			
		2.3.5	"Above the line", it  is your  WARNING SIGNAL  if  SALES and DIRECT COST  are  not  in  line  with  each
			other. The importance  of  this  warning  signal  can  never  be  over-estimated,  not  only  because  these two
			are  vital  measures to  the  business,   but  also because  both  SALES  and  DIRECT COST  are  potentially 
			very VULNERABLE.
			
		2.3.6	On  the one  hand, every  product  your  business  produces  and  sells  is  in  competition  with  the products
			supplied  by   your   competitors.  The   SELLING PRICE  of   your  product   feels  this  competition   and  is 
			therefore  constantly exposed  to  pressure.  Increase your  SELLING PRICE  to  increase  GROSS PROFIT,
			and your business  runs the  risk of  losing customers. Reduce the  SELLING PRICE  to get more customers
			(VOLUME) and  you  sacrifice important  GROSS  PROFIT.
			
		2.3.7	On the  other hand, the  COST OF PRODUCING  a  product  is   the  function  of  the  COST OF MATERIAL,
			the  COST  and  EFFICIENCY  of  your  LABOUR,  the  WASTEAGE  of  MATERIAL etc.  and  these  factors 
			are  a  constant  threat  to   the  erosion  of   GROSS PROFIT.  An  increase  in MATERIAL PRICES  by your
			supplier  will  leave you  facing  the  decision  to  either  increase  the  SELLING PRICE  or  face  a  reduction
			in  GROSS PROFIT. An  increase  in   WAGE COST  will   present  the  same  dilemma.  And  so  will  many
			other  cost  items  directly  involved  in  producing  the  product  your  business  sells.									
												
			The  barometer  for  the  effect  of   all  these, mostly  external,  influences  is  the  GROSS PROFIT  of  your									
			business.  It  is  THE  MOST  IMPORTANT  WARNING  SIGNAL  at  your  disposal   to help  you defend your									
			business against  all  those  external  and  internal  factors threatening to  turn  your  business  upside  down.									
												
			RULE 1:	WATCH YOUR GROSS PROFIT CLOSELY								
												
			RULE 2:	PROTECT YOUR GROSS PROFIT WITH YOUR LIFE								
												
		2.3.8	There  is  a  further  equally  vital  reason  for   the  importance   of   GROSS PROFIT;  the   responsibility  for									
			covering  the  OVERHEAD  of  your  business.									
												
		2.3.9	The  'Mount Everest'   of  business   is   PRODUCING  SUFFICIENT  GROSS  PROFIT   to  cover  the  FIXED									
			OVERHEAD of   the business consistently. The higher  the FIXED OVERHEAD of the business, the tougher it									
			is for the  GROSS PROFIT  of  the business to  cover it.  And,  as  we  have  seen,  GROSS PROFIT  already									
			runs  the  constant  risk  of  pressure  from  a  delicate  relationship  between  SALES  and  DIRECT COSTS.									
												
		2.3.10	The responsibility  for maintaining  a healthy relationship between GROSS PROFIT  and  FIXED OVERHEAD,									
			leading  to  consistent  NET PROFIT  for  the  business,  therefore lies far  more  with the FIXED OVERHEAD									
			component of  the business than  it lies with GROSS PROFIT. But the importance of GROSS PROFIT  in the									
			equation  is  that,  just  like with  SALES  and  DIRECT COST,  GROSS PROFIT  will  constantly  serve  as a									
			WARNING SIGNAL  whenever  FIXED OVERHEAD becomes excessive.									
												
			RULE 3 PROTECT your GROSS PROFIT by keeping YOUR FIXED OVERHEAD AS LOW AS POSSIBLE	PROTECT your GROSS PROFIT by keeping your OVERHEAD AS LOW AS POSSIBLE								
- 3 -												
												
	2.4	CALCULATING THE GROSS PROFIT OF YOUR BUSINESS										

		2.4.1	SALES LESS DIRECT COSTS (The MACRO way)									
			As mentioned earlier,  on a  larger (macro)  business scale, GROSS PROFIT  is  the difference  between  the									
			SALES  of  the business  and  it's DIRECT COST,  i.e.  the  COSTS DIRECTLY INCURRED in PRODUCING									
			the  product.  It  is  therefore  relatively  simple   to  ascertain  the   GROSS PROFIT   of  one's  business  by									
			checking  one's  ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  for the detail,  or even  more regularly  doing the same									
			exercise   by  using  one's   MONTHLY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS,   should  one  have  access  to  same.									

			Simply, GROSS PROFIT = SALES less DIRECT COSTS									

		2.4.2	GROSS PROFIT %									

			This is the GROSS PROFIT expressed as a percentage of SALES, i.e.									

				GROSS PROFIT %		=	GROSS PROFIT			OR		
							SALES					

				GROSS PROFIT %		=	SALES - DIRECT COSTS					
							SALES					

			Hence,  if  SALES equals 100  and  GROSS PROFIT equals 40,  then the  GROSS PROFIT % is 40%.									

		2.4.3	THE DISADVANTAGES OF THE "MACRO" WAY									
			Whilst  this  exercise  provides  one  with  the  necessary  information  on  one's   GROSS PROFIT,  it  is  far									
			from  the  ideal  way  to  monitor  one's  GROSS PROFIT.  The  reasons  for  this are:									

			2.4.3.1	GROSS PROFIT is too important to be monitored on an ANNUAL basis only;								
												
			2.4.3.2	GROSS PROFIT obtained from  ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS or MONTHLY MANAGEMENT								
				ACCOUNTS is historic of nature and not sufficiently 'real-time';								
												
			2.4.3.3	The  information  obtained  on  the  GROSS PROFIT   from  MONTHLY MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTS								
				is  a  COMPOSITE,   ONE-FIGURE  GROSS  PROFIT.  Any  problem   identified  with  the  GROSS								
				PROFIT  obtained  from  this  source  will  cause  more  frustration  and anguish  than  anything else,								
				as  one  will   not  have  the  ability   to  "drill-down"   to  the  specific   area  or  product  causing  the								
				problem.								
				For example: Let us assume the  NORMAL GROSS PROFIT for your business is 30%. An analysis
				of  the  MONTHLY  MANAGEMENT  ACCOUNTS   shows  that  the  GROSS PROFIT  has suddenly
				dropped to 25%. Where are you going  to start looking for  the reason? And  whilst you are  searching
				for  the  problem, you  have the  anguish of  having to wait  till the  end of  next month  to see whether
				the  problem  remains ( or  is  maybe  even  worse).

			2.4.3.4	Trying  to  manage  your  GROSS PROFIT  by simply  monitoring it  in  the above-mentioned  manner
				is  at  most  a  REACTIVE,  rather  than  a  PROACTIVE  way  of  managing  a  vital  element of your
				business.  GROSS PROFIT  is  too  important  to  your   business  to  manage  it  in  any  other  way
				than  being  PROACTIVE  about  it.
				
			2.4.3.5	Finally,  by  not  providing   your  business  with  an  accurate  and  pro-active  PRODUCT COSTING
				SYSTEM,  you  deprive   it  of   a   MOST IMPORTANT TOOL, i.e.  the  GROSS PROFIT  of  EVERY
				PRODUCT  produced  by  your business, rather than the   GROSS  PROFIT of your  BUSINESS  as
				a whole.
				
				With  all  the  emphasis  on   BUSINESS  GROSS  PROFIT,   one  must not  forget the vital benefits								
				of  an accurate  PRODUCT  COSTING  SYSTEM  for  a  business.  These  benefits,  along  with  the								
				process  of  creating   and  bedding  down  an  accurate   PRODUCT  COSTING  SYSTEM   for  your								
				business,  will  be  highlighted  in  the  following section.								
												
			RULE 4 : CONTROL YOUR GROSS PROFIT BY MONITORING IT PER INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT	CONTROL YOUR GROSS PROFIT BY MONITORING IT PER INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT								
- 4 -												
												
		2.4.4	CALCULATING YOUR GROSS PROFIT PER PRODUCT (THE "MICRO" WAY)									
												
			2.4.4.1	Just as each of  the Products your business sells  can be  seen as  a "column" which,  when added								
				together  make  up  the entire house  which is  your  business,  each "column"  consists of "blocks",								
				which is the various cost components and the product profit, which in turn make up each product.								
												
				This is an illustration of the above, reflected in percentages:								
												
						PRODUCT 1	PRODUCT 2	PRODUCT 3	PRODUCT 4	PRODUCT 5		ALL PRODS.
				SELLING PRICE		100	100	100	100	100		100
												
						40	60	80	50	30		40
												
												
				DIRECT COST						70		
						60						60
									50			
				GROSS PROFIT			40					
												
								20				
												
												
						30	30	30	30	30		30
				OVERHEAD								
												
												
						30	10	-10	20	40		30
				NET PROFIT								
												
												
												
				In the above example,  Products 1 and 5  are  strong contributors  to  business profit,  Product 4 is								
				reasonable,  Product 2  is  marginal  and  Product 3 does not succeed in covering the Overhead.								
												
				In essence, if your business was largely made up of Products 1 and 5, it would have been HEALTHY.								
				If  your  business  was  made  up  only  of  Product 3,  it  would  be  in  SEVERE TROUBLE.								
												
				Obviously, your  business  will  sell  DIFFERING VOLUMES of  EACH  PRODUCT.  Should  you  sell 								
				far more of Products 1 and 5 than the rest, your  business  will  be HEALTHY.  Should you  sell more								
				of  Product 3  and  even  Product 2,  your  business  will  be  in  TROUBLE.								
												
				NOTE  the  OVERALL BUSINESS GROWTH PROFIT  on  the  very  RIGHT  of  the  example.								
				In  this  example,  you would  be  happy with  the  OVERALL BREAKDOWN   of  your  business  and								
				you  may  think that it  is not that necessary  to be aware of the BREAKDOWN for EACH PRODUCT.								
												
				However, there are TWO REASONS why you ALWAYS need to be aware of the COST BREAKDOWN								
				for each INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT. The first is that often  a business would  NOT BE AS FORTUNATE								
				with it's  COST BREAKDOWN as  the above  picture depicts. The  second is  that, even  if  the above								
				COST BREAKDOWN  reflects your  business  closely,  there will  still  be  SOME PRODUCTS which								
				UNDER-PERFORM  as  with Product 3.  Having a system in  place  which  determines  INDIVIDUAL								
				PRODUCT COST and  GROSS PROFIT, enables you  to constantly  IMPROVE BUSINESS GROSS								
				PROFIT  by  IDENTIFYING THE POOR  GROSS PROFIT PRODUCTS  and  either  CHANGE THEIR								
				PRICE  and  COST COMPONENTS  or  even  ELIMINATING THOSE PRODUCTS.								
												
				It is clear that the difference between each product above is the DIRECT COST attached to each one.								
				The  DIRECT  COST  of  each  Product  is  determined  by  attaching  the  costs  which are  directly 								
				identifiable with the Product. Whilst the costs which can  be directly attached to each product vary								
				from  industry  to  industry,   the  DIRECT COSTS   for  most  industries  consist  of  MATERIAL and								
				LABOUR.								
												
				Once the DIRECT COSTS have  been  identified  and attached  to  each Product,  the  BALANCE OF 								
				COST  REMAINING  is  considered  OVERHEAD.  This  OVERHEAD  has  to  be  allocated  to  each 								
				Product  by  finding  an  APPROPRIATE BASE  for  ALLOCATION OF THE OVERHEAD.								
												
				The  BASE  for  the  allocation  of  OVERHEAD  is  normally   a  unit  such  as  LABOUR HOURS  or 								
				MATERIAL  KG'S  or  METRES.								
												
			2.4.4.2	The methodology for the above  process is discussed  in the following section, but before we get there								
				we have to sidetrack  to discuss one other very  important  factor in  any  business,  one  we  will call:								
- 5 -												
												
	2.5	MISSION  # 1  :     "ACHIEVING  BREAKEVEN"										
												
		2.5.1	WHAT IS BREAK-EVEN?									
			A  very  important   exercise  to  do  in  your  business  (new or old)  is  to  determine, and  constantly  remain									
			aware  of,  the  BREAKEVEN-POINT of  the business.  The  BREAKEVEN-POINT  is  essentially  the  level of									
			TURNOVER  at which the business makes  sufficient GROSS PROFIT to cover the FIXED OVERHEAD of the									
			business.									
												
			A repeat of the example in section 2.2.3., but at the BREAKEVEN-POINT, shows the following:									
												
				SALES		100		100%				
			Less:	DIRECT COST		60		60%				
			Equals:	GROSS PROFIT		40		40%				
			Less:	OVERHEAD		40		40%				
			Equals:	NET PROFIT		0		0%				
												
												
			In  this  example,  both  GROSS PROFIT  and FIXED OVERHEAD are 40, hence the business does not make 									
			any  PROFIT.  The  above  means  that  SALES  of  100  has  delivered  a  GROSS PROFIT of 40  (40%)  and									
			the  FIXED OVERHEAD  of  the  business  also  at  40,  the  NET PROFIT  is 0.									
												
		2.5.2	HOW TO CALCULATE BREAKEVEN.									
			To  calculate  the  BREAKEVEN  of  your  business  at  any  time,  the  following  process  is  followed:									
												
			2.5.2.1	Determine the OVERHEAD of your business for a period, say a month.								
				NOTE AGAIN:  OVERHEAD  is that  cost which  you  CANNOT ATTACH DIRECTLY  to the Product. 								
				It is  that  cost  which  you  HAVE TO PAY  every  month,  regardless  of  whether  the  business has 								
				made money or  not.  An  example  is  Rent; another  is a repayment on a delivery vehicle. 								
												
			2.5.2.2	Determine the GROSS PROFIT % of your business.								
				You do  this by  first  determining  your SALES for  the same  period, then your  DIRECT COSTS and								
				then  DEDUCTING the  latter  from the  former, which  gives  you  your  GROSS PROFIT.  By dividing								
				the  GROSS  PROFIT  by  the  SALES,  you  get  your  GROSS PROFIT %.								
												
			2.5.3.2	DIVIDE  the  OVERHEAD,  in 2.5.2.1,  by  the   GROSS PROFIT %  in  2.5.2.2								
				The  figure  you  obtain  by  doing  this,  is  the  SALES (TURNOVER)  the  business  requires  in the								
				period to BREAKEVEN.								
												
				An example:								
				- OVERHEAD				R 40,000				
				- GROSS PROFIT %				40%				
				- BREAKEVEN SALES				R 100,000	<-------------	R40,000 / 40%		
												
												
		2.5.3	WHY BREAKEVEN IS VITAL TO ANY BUSINESS.									
												
			2.5.3.1	A few examples of BREAKEVEN will hopefully illustrate it's importance:								
												
							1	2	3	4	5	6
				- OVERHEAD			R 20,000	R 25,000	R 30,000	R 40,000	R 50,000	R 100,000
				- GROSS PROFIT %			30%	25%	20%	10%	50%	50%
				- BREAKEVEN SALES			R 66,667	R 100,000	R 150,000	R 400,000	R 100,000	R 200,000
												
				The  above  6 examples  highlight  a vitally  important  relationship  in  a  business  and  stresses  the								
				importance  of  previous  sections  which  highlighted  the  importance  of:								
				- protecting  the  GROSS PROFIT  of  your  business  with  your  life  and								
				- keeping  OVERHEAD as  low  as  possible.								
												
				GROSS PROFIT  and  OVERHEAD  run  together  in a business;  a  STRONG GROSS PROFIT with								
				LOW  OVERHEAD  will  deliver  solid  profits  all  round.  An  example  is  No 1  and  No 5  above.								
												
				But,  HIGH  OVERHEAD  with  a  LOW GROSS PROFIT,  as  with  No 3 and 4  above,  will demand								
				a  CONSISTENTLY HIGH TURNOVER (SALES)  to  keep  your  business  in  profit.								
												
				Even  if  you  manage  to  achieve the  relationship  in No 2 and 6 above,  it will  not  be  as  ideal  as								
				achieving  the  combination  in  No 1  and  No 5.  That  is  because  of  the  effect  on  your  business								
				once   it    GOES  BEYOND   the   BREAKEVEN-POINT  -  the  last  VERY  IMPORTANT  aspect  of								
				BREAKEVEN-ANALYSIS.								
- 6 -												
												
			2.5.3.2	Look at the 3 scenario's below:								
												
							Scenario 1		Scenario 2		Scenario 3	
					SALES		R 100,000		R 120,000		R 200,000	
				Less:	VARIABLE COST		R 60,000		R 72,000		R 120,000	
				Equals:	GROSS PROFIT		R 40,000		R 48,000		R 80,000	
				Less:	FIXED COSTS		R 40,000		R 40,000		R 40,000	
				Equals:	NET PROFIT		R 0		R 8,000		R 40,000	
												
				Scenario 1:	Shows  a BREAKEVEN situation, as discussed  earlier. GROSS PROFIT at 40% delivers							
					a  GROSS PROFIT  of  R40,000  on a TURNOVER  of  R100,000, which  exactly covers							
					the FIXED OVERHEAD of R40,000, delivering a NET PROFIT of R0.
					
				Scenario 2:	TURNOVER increases by 20% or R20,000 to R120,000.
					
					You will notice that this increase leads to 2 things:
					1. GROSS PROFIT  also  increases  by  20%,  which  translates  to  R8,000;
					2. NET PROFIT  also  increases  by  R8,000.
					
					This  illustrates  the effect of  what  is  called  SUPER-PROFITS,  which is  achieved  by a
					business  once it  has  achieved it's  BREAKEVEN-POINT.  It  means that  ONE RAND of
					ADDITIONAL  SALES  delivers  ONE  RAND  of  ADDITIONAL  NET  PROFIT.
					
					The  above  happens  because   the  OVERHEAD   is  FIXED  and  as  such  has  already
					been  covered  by   the  GROSS  PROFIT  derived   from  the  BREAKEVEN  SALES. The
					EXTRA  GROSS  PROFIT  achieved  translates  directly  into  the  same  NET PROFIT.
					
					The huge effect this has on any business is even better illustrated in Scenario 3.
					
				Scenario 3:	TURNOVER doubles from R100,000 to R200,000.
					The effect is:
					1. GROSS PROFIT  increases  by  R40,000,  which  is  40% (GP%)  of  R100,000;
					2. NET PROFIT  also  increases  by  R40,000.
					
					That carries through  the principle of  SUPER-PROFITS, but  there is more  if you compare
					the  NET PROFIT  increase  from  Scenario 2  to  Scenario 3:
					- SALES  has  increased  by  66.7%  (R120,000  to  R200,000)
					- GROSS PROFIT  has  increased  by  66.7%  (R48,000  to  R80,000)
					
					  BUT: NET PROFIT has increased by 400%, from R8,000 to R40,000
					
				The  above  hopefully  has  created   both  an  understanding  of  BREAKEVEN  and  the  importance 	
				of  it  to  any  business. Not  only  is  it  vital  that  you  PROTECT THE  GROSS PROFIT  OF YOUR 	
				BUSINESS  and   KEEP   OVERHEAD   AS   LOW  AS  POSSIBLE   in   order  that  your  business								
				DOES  NOT  LOSE  MONEY, but  it  is  as  vital  on  the   ROAD TO ACHIEVING SUPER-PROFITS.

3.	PRINCIPLES OF COSTING YOUR PRODUCT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS											
												
	3.1	A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU USE PRODUCT COSTING TO MAKE EFFECTIVE										
		BUSINESS DECISIONS										
												
		3.1.1	A  PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM  relates  the  SELLING PRICE  of  every  product  your  business  sells to									
			COST OF MANUFACTURE  of  that  product,  providing  you  with  a  GROSS PROFIT  for  each  product. A									
			proper  PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM   will  indicate   to  you  through   the  projected   PRODUCT GROSS  									
			PROFIT, whether components  of  certain  Products  should  be  changed  and  also  whether  a certain  order									
			should be taken on or not.									
												
		3.1.2	An Example of this is:									
										
			Say you set the  OVERALL GROSS PROFIT TARGET  for  your business at  30%. You have calculated your 							
			FIXED COST and you are  satisfied that  a 30% GROSS PROFIT  for  the business  will  cover  those FIXED 							
			COSTS. 							
										
			A  customer  now  places  an  order  with  your business. In terms of  SALES VALUE, it is  say  25%  of  the							
			current sales of your  business,  so  you will  dearly like  to  take on  the order.  But the question you need to							
			ask  is  not  what   the sales  value  of  the  order  is,  but  what  GROSS PROFIT  the  order  DELIVERS TO							
			THE  BUSINESS.  So,  BEFORE  accepting  the  order,  you  need  to  determine  what  it is going  to COST							
			you  to  PRODUCE  the  order.  Remember,  you  need  to   PROTECT  THE  GROSS  PROFIT  OF  YOUR							
			BUSINESS at all cost, even if it sometimes means turning away a large order.							
										
			In  this  example, you  calculate  your  PRODUCT  COST   and  the  GROSS PROFIT  which  the  order  will							
			deliver  and  you  realise  that  the  ORDER  GROSS  PROFIT  is  10%. Do  you  accept  the  order  or  not ?							
										
		3.1.3			Current		Order		Total	
					Turnover	%	Turnover	%	Turnover	%
										
			Turnover		10000		2500		12500	
										
			Gross Profit		3000	30.0%	250	10.0%	3250	26.0%
										
			Fixed Cost		2000		0		2000	
										
			Net Profit		1000		250		1250	
										
		3.1.4	The above example shows the following:							
			3.1.4.1	TURNOVER  increases  by  R2,500  or 25% from  R10,000  to  R12,500.						
			3.1.4.2	GROSS PROFIT  increases  by  R250  or  8.33%  from  R3,000  to  R3,250.						
			3.1.4.3	GROSS PROFIT OVERALL  decreases  from  30%  to  26%.						
										
		3.1.5	The  WARNING SIGNALS  that the  above should  send to you prior to accepting the order are the following:							
				
			3.1.5.1	Your  OVERALL GROSS PROFIT  is now  4% BELOW the TARGET  and is now entrenched in your 
				business.  To get it back to 30% AVERAGE some time in the future on a same-size order, your
				NEXT ORDER will have to deliver a 46% GROSS PROFIT, not an easy thing to find.
				
			3.1.5.2	You  are taking  on  an  order which is  delivering an  extra  8.33% gross profit, which will  demand a:
				
				- 25% extra PRODUCTION EFFORT;
				- 25% extra MANAGEMENT EFFORT;
				- 25% extra QUALITY CONTROL;
				- 25% increase in MATERIAL PURCHASES and therefore, in month-end CREDITORS PAYMENTS;
				- an increase in RAW MATERIAL STOCKS and FINISHED GOODS STOCKS;
				- quite possibly, an increase in your DEBTORS BALANCES OUTSTANDING.
				
				The  above  factors  will  result  both  in  a  substantial  increase  in  MANAGEMENT EFFORT  and a
				CASH STRAIN  on  your  business.
												
			3.1.5.3	As  importantly,  taking  on  the order  will   INCREASE the BREAKEVEN-POINT  of  your  business.								
				Using the knowledge  we have  gained  in Section 2.5.2  above,  we can  calculate  the BREAKEVEN								
				SALES of the business as it is currently and as it will be once we take on the order:								
												
						NOW			THEN			
				Fixed Cost		R 2,000			R 2,000			
				G.P. %		30%			26%			
				Breakeven Sales		R 6,667			R 7,692			
- 8 -												
												
				This  means that  by  taking  on  the  order,  you have  just  increased  the  SALES  required for  your								
				business to  BREAK EVEN, from R6,667 to R7,692, a 15% increase in BREAKEVEN requirement.								
												
		3.1.6	On the surface,  without the benefit of a PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT,  a potential 25% increase in SALES									
			looks too good  to be missed. It is only when one has the benefit of  a proper PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM									
			allowing  one  to  calculate the  CONTRIBUTION OF THE  ORDER TO GROSS PROFIT,  that  one sees the									
			the  danger  of  accepting  this  particular  order.									
												
			Let us now go and see how we determine individual PRODUCT COST.									
												
	3.2	THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF AN EFFECTIVE PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM										
												
		3.2.1	A PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM consists of TWO components:									
			3.2.1.1	All the COSTS of the business and								
			3.2.1.2	A BASE on which to apply those COSTS to the PRODUCT.								
												
		3.2.2	DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS.									
												
			3.2.2.1	DIRECT COSTS								
												
				These  are the COSTS which one can identify directly with the product.								
				(If the people or items comprising these costs are not at work, the work WILL NOT happen)
				For Example: The LABOUR which applies a HANDLE to a CUP
				                  :  The LABOUR which applies the MATERIAL to a CHAIR
				                  :  The MATERIAL which comprises the CLAY of the HANDLE and the CUP
				                  :  The MATERIAL which comprises the CLOTH of the CHAIR
				
				These DIRECT COSTS are calculated with the help of identifying a DIRECT STANDARD for 
				each Product.
				In  the case of  DIRECT LABOUR,  the  TIME  it  takes to  complete each  DIRECT TASK  in making
				the  Product  is  identified  and  multiplied  with  the  LABOUR RATE  that  that  task  gets  paid.
				
				In  the  case  of  DIRECT MATERIALS,  the  QUANTITY  of  material  used  to  produce  the  Product
				is  identified  and  multiplied  with  the  UNIT COST  of  that  material.
				
				A later section will deal with the detail of how these standards are identified and incorporated
				into the Product cost.
												
			3.2.2.2	INDIRECT COSTS								
												
				These are the COSTS which one has difficulty with attaching to a specific product ONLY.								
				(If the people or items comprising these costs are not at work, the work WILL STILL happen)								
				For Example: The LABOUR from the WORKSHOP which repairs a machine								
				                  :  The LABOUR which SUPERVISES the department								
				                  :  The MATERIAL which is used to CLEAN product								
				                  :  The MATERIAL which PROTECTS the staff								
												
			3.2.2.3	A COSTING BASE FOR INDIRECT COSTS								
												
				INDIRECT COSTS have to be APPLIED over a certain pre-determined BASE.								
				The nature of this  BASE will be  determined by  the  TYPE OF MANUFACTURING  you  are  involved								
				in and  especially  important will  be  what the  most  important  COST DRIVER  is  in  the  business.								
				For  instance,  if  say   40%  of  your  OVERALL COST   is  LABOUR   producing  the  product,  your								
				COST DRIVER  will more than likely be  LABOUR HOURS. Other BASES for the apllication of COST								
				are  WEIGHT (of MATERIAL)  and  LENGTH  (of MATERIAL)

4.	BUILDING  PRODUCT COST FROM SCRATCH											
												
	4.1	DIRECT LABOUR COST										
												
		4.1.1	WHERE DOES IT FIT IN?									
												
			The DIRECT LABOUR  involved in  producing  each  product   is   attached to  that product  by identifying and 									
			then  costing  the  labour  involved with  each  product. This  is actually  easier  than what  it  sounds,  as long									
			as  you have  identifiable  TIME STANDARDS  for  each TASK performed  in producing  the  ultimate  product.									
			If  you do not  have  a TIME STANDARD  as above,  you  have  to  create  it  by  a  process of  TIMING  each									
			TASK  in  the  process  and  then  adding  the TIME  for  each  TASK  in  the process  together  to  derive the 									
			TOTAL  TASK  TIME  of  each  product.   Once  you  have  done  so,  you  are  ready  to  apply  the  relevant									
			LABOUR RATE  to  the  TOTAL TASK TIME  to  arrive  at  the  LABOUR COST  of  each  product.									
												
			A set out of the above, working from top to bottom, is as follows:									
												
						PRODUCT COST						
												
					DIRECT COST				OVERHEAD			
												
			LABOUR COST			MATERIAL COST						
												
												
			LABOUR HOURS		X	LABOUR RATE						
												
		4.1.2	DIRECT LABOUR STANDARDS									
												
			4.1.1.1	AN EXAMPLE								
												
				A simple example of arriving at the TOTAL TASK TIME for a product is as follows:								
												
				PRODUCT :		A  T-Shirt						
												
					TASK				TASK TIME (Smins)			
					Join Shoulders				0.56			
					Insert Sleeves				0.74			
					Close 1st Side Seam				0.60			
					Close 2nd Side Seam				0.71			
					Bartack Seam				0.15			
												
												
												
												
					LABOUR S Mins				2.76			
				
				The above means that to  do all the  identified tasks attached  to producing a  T-Shirt will take
				2.76 Standard minutes  or  0.046 hours.
				
				NOTE  that  ONLY  the LABOUR   which is DIRECTLY  attached  to the PRODUCT  is identified  and 
				included. Tasks  such  as  Drawing  the  Couch  or  Supervising  the  production  are  EXCLUDED.
				
				ALSO NOTE that one of the MAJOR BENEFITS of  identifying  your  LABOUR HOURS  per  Product,
				is that this TIME becomes the STANDARD for each Product. Once known,  it  will  enable  you  to:
				
				- monitor your  ACTUAL Labour Time Paid against  your  STANDARD Labour Times  and address
				  any  OVER-USAGES  due  to  inefficient labour etc.
				
				- determine your MONTHLY  LABOUR  REQUIREMENTS  by  MULTIPLYING the  LABOUR HOURS
				  REQUIRED  for   each  TASK per PRODUCT  by the  ANTICIPATED PRODUCTION  VOLUMES of 
				  each  PRODUCT.
												
				The above will be discussed under a following section.								
- 10 -												
												
		4.1.3	DIRECT LABOUR RATE									
												
				Once the  TOTAL TASK TIME has been  identified as in the example above,  it remains  for  the TIME								
				(HOURS) to be multiplied with the appropriate LABOUR RATE(S)  to determine the DIRECT LABOUR 								
				COST of the  Product. An example of this is:								
												
				PRODUCT :		A  2-SEATER  COUCH						
												
					TASK			TIME (hours)		RATE  (per hour)		LABOUR COST
					Join Shoulders			0.00933		R 14.00		R 0.13
					Insert Sleeves			0.01233		R 14.00		R 0.17
					Close 1st Side Seam			0.01000		R 14.00		R 0.14
					Close 2nd Side Seam			0.01183		R 14.00		R 0.17
					Bartack Seam			0.00250		R 14.00		R 0.04
								0.00000		R 14.00		R 0.00
								0.00000		R 14.00		R 0.00
								0.00000		R 14.00		R 0.00
								0.00000		R 14.00		R 0.00
					LABOUR HOURS			0.04600				R 0.64
												
			In the above exercise, note the following:									
												
			- the LABOUR RATES for virtually each TASK are DIFFERENT.									
												
			  Most businesses  employ  more than  one person  and  each person  is allocated  a different  TASK or JOB,									
			  based  on  the  individual  SKILL LEVELS  of  each person  and  each  person  is  paid  a RATE PER HOUR									
			  based  on  those  individual   SKILL LEVELS.  Hence,  most  TASKS  will  attract  DIFFERENT RATES  per									
			  HOUR.									
												
			- the STEPS in arriving at a LABOUR COST for a Product are:									
												
			  - identify each TASK required to produce the Product;									
			  - obtain the TIME required for each TASK to be performed for each Product;									
			  - identify the PERSON who will perform each TASK;									
			  - apply the RATE per HOUR of that PERSON to the relevant TASK;									
			  - MULTIPLY each TASK TIME with the appropriate RATE per HOUR;									
			  - ADD UP the LABOUR COST per HOUR for each TASK to arrive at the LABOUR COST of the PRODUCT.									
												
		The  above  process will deliver the  DIRECT LABOUR COST  of each  product in  your business and  means that you										
		are  'halfway'   to  determining  your  OVERALL  DIRECT COST  of  each  product. 										
												
	4.2	DIRECT MATERIAL COST										
												
		4.2.1	WHERE DOES IT FIT IN?									
										
			In  many  ways,  identifying and attaching  DIRECT MATERIALS  to  each  Product is  easier  than  the above							
			procedure  for  DIRECT LABOUR.  Using the same set out as for DIRECT LABOUR shows the following:							
										
						PRODUCT COST				
										
					DIRECT COST				INDIRECT COST	
										
			LABOUR COST			MATERIAL COST				
										
										
					NO. OF UNITS		X	MATERIAL PRICE		
										
			Each  Product will  attract either  no,  one or  more than one MATERIAL TYPES in DIFFERING QUANTITIES.							
			Once  the  different  MATERIAL TYPES  are  identified  for  the  Product,  you will  know  it's PRICE from your							
			PURCHASING  or  STOCK  records   and  you   just  have  to  determine   HOW MUCH  of  each  MATERIAL							
			attaches  to  each  Product.									
												
			In  SUMMARY,   you  need  to  do   the  following  to  arrive  at  the  COST of MATERIAL  for  each  Product:									
			-  IDENTIFY  each  MATERIAL   which  DIRECTLY  attaches  to  the  Product;									
			- obtain  the  PRICE  for  each  of  these  MATERIALS;									
			- ascertain  HOW MUCH  of  each  MATERIAL  is  required  for  each  Product.									
- 11 -												
												
		4.2.2	DIRECT MATERIAL STANDARDS									
												
			4.2.2.1	AN EXAMPLE								
												
				An example, using the same Product as for the DIRECT LABOUR computation, is as follows: 								
												
				PRODUCT :		A  2-SEATER  COUCH						
												
					MATERIAL TYPE				MATERIAL QUANTITY	
					Wood				3	
					Sponge				4	
					Material				4	
					Thread				0.5	
					Staples				30	
										
				NOTE  that  it is not necessary  to  ADD UP  the  above  as  all  the MATERIAL TYPES  are different.						
										
				ALSO NOTE   that  each   of   the  MATERIAL QUANTITIES  will   be   denominated  in  a  UNIT  OF						
				MEASURE such as Metres (m), Square Metres (m²) or Kilograms (kg).						
										
				ALSO NOTE that one of the MAJOR BENEFITS of identifying your MATERIAL QUANTITIES per						
				Product, is that this QUANTITY becomes the STANDARD USAGE for each Product. Once known,						
				it will enable you to:						
										
				- monitor your  ACTUAL Material Usage  against  your  STANDARD Material Usage  and  address								
				  any  OVER-USAGES  due  to  excessive wastage etc.								
												
				- determine   your   MONTHLY  MATERIAL  REQUIREMENTS  by   MULTIPLYING  the  QUANTITY								
				  REQUIRED  for   each  MATERIAL TYPE   by  the   ANTICIPATED  PRODUCTION  VOLUMES  of 								
				  each  PRODUCT.								
												
				The above will be discussed under a following section.								
												
		4.2.3	DIRECT MATERIAL RATES									
												
			Once  the  MATERIAL  TYPES   and  their   QUANTITIES  per  PRODUCT   have  been  identified, it remains									
			for  the  UNIT PRICES to be identified for each MATERIAL and same to be MULTIPLIED by the QUANTITIES									
			to determine the  MATERIAL COST  of the  Product.  An example of this is:									
												
					MATERIAL TYPE			MATERIAL QUANTITY	UNIT of MEASURE	PRICE (per unit)		MATERIALCOST
					Wood			3	m	R 45.00		R 135.00
					Sponge			4	m²	R 5.00		R 20.00
					Material			4	m	R 120.00		R 480.00
					Thread			0.5	m	R 0.50		R 0.25
					Staples			30	each	R 0.05		R 1.50
					TOTAL COST							R 636.75
												
			The above process will deliver the  DIRECT MATERIAL COST  of each  product in your  business  and means									
			that you now have both this and the DIRECT LABOUR COST determined. 									
												
	4.3	DIRECT OVERALL COST										
												
			Based on the above example, it means that your TOTAL DIRECT COST is as follows:									
												
			Direct Labour Cost			R 0.64						
			Direct Material Cost			R 636.75						
			Total Direct Cost			R 637.39						
												
			It is  vital  to note at  this point  that,  once  you  know  what  the  SELLING PRICE  of  the  Product is, you									
			now  have  all   the  relevant   information  available   for  the  Product  up  to  GROSS PROFIT  stage.   What									
			remains to arrive at FULL PRODUCT COST is the allocation of OVERHEAD.									
- 12 -												
												
	4.4	ALLOCATING OVERHEAD TO THE PRODUCT										
												
		So far,  we  have  ALLOCATED  the  DIRECT  COSTS,  which  largely  consist  of  DIRECT  LABOUR  and  DIRECT										
		MATERIAL, to  the  Product. In  the example  above, we  have  assumed an  OVERHEAD of  R10,000  for the  month.										
		OVERHEAD consists  of  all  the  EXPENSES  which  are  NOT DIRECTLY  INDENTIFIABLE  WITH THE PRODUCT.										
		These EXPENSES  include RENT,  SALARIES,  ELECTICITY,  INSURANCE,  INDIRECT WAGES etc.  An  accurate										
		PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM  will  also  ALLOCATE OVERHEAD  per  Product,  based  on  a certain BASIS FOR										
		ALLOCATION.										
												
		4.4.1	DETERMINING THE COSTING BASE									
												
			The  key  to  the  effective  ALLOCATION  OF OVERHEAD  to  the  Product  is  the  COSTING BASE  that is									
			used. For  purposes of explanation,  forget  about the  INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF OVERHEAD  for  the  moment									
			and  let  us  use  the  R10,000 OVERHEAD  used  in  previous  examples  first.									
												
			The  purpose  of  the  exercise  is  to  DISTRIBUTE THE R10,000 OVERHEAD across the Product, i.e. divide 									
			the OVERHEAD COST over all the Products. To do this, we first have to IDENTIFY THE CORRECT COSTING									
			BASE.									
												
		4.4.2	DIFFERENT TYPES OF COSTING BASE									
												
			The  COSTING BASE  one  uses  will  depend  on  the  MAIN  ACTIVITY  BASE  of  your  business.  Mostly, 									
			because  most  businesses  are  largely  dependant upon LABOUR,  the  COSTING BASE will be LABOUR 									
			HOURS.  However, in certain  instances,  where  the  business  is  largely  driven  by  MATERIAL,  this  could 									
			also  serve  as  the  base. In turn, when  using  MATERIAL  as  the  base, you  may  want to  MEASURE  the									
			BASE  in  MATERIAL KILOGRAMS,  METRES,  SQUARE METRES  or  even  LITRES.									
												
			BUT, as  LABOUR HOURS  are  used in  the  majority of instances,  your COSTING PROGRAMME  attached									
			makes  use  of   LABOUR HOURS  as  it's  COSTING  BASE.  Should  it  prove  that  a  MATERIAL-BASED									
			COSTING SYSTEM  is  required for  your  specific business,  the BASE  could  be  adjusted  upon  request.									
												
		4.4.3	HOW A COSTING BASE IS DESIGNED BASED ON LABOUR HOURS									
												
			Whilst  all  of  the  above  may  sound  terribly  complicated,  it  is  actually not. For  purposes  of  illustration,									
			let  us  use  the  following  figures  from  previous  examples:									
												
			Overhead per Month					R10,000				
			Volume of Product to be sold					35	units			
			Labour Minutes per Product					170				
												
			In the above,we are using the No.of Units calculated in 4.4.6 above and the Labour Minutes for the Product									
			is as per 4.4.5 above.									
												
			4.4.3.1	CALCULATING THE LABOUR HOURS TO BE USED								
												
			We  have decided  to use LABOUR HOURS  as the  BASIS for ALLOCATING OVERHEAD  to  the  Product.									
			That  means   that   the   FIRST STEP   is  to   determine  the   TOTAL  LABOUR  HOURS  required  by  the 									
			business  for  the PERIOD  ON  WHICH  THE  OVERHEAD  IS  BASED.  In  this  instance,  the  OVERHEAD									
			cost  of  R10,000  is  for  the  MONTH,  so  the  LABOUR  STANDARD  PER HOUR  must  be  MULTIPLIED 									
			by  the  ANTICIPATED  VOLUME  for  the  MONTH.									
												
			Labour Minutes per Product				170					
			Labour Hours per Product				2.8333	(170/60)				
												
			Volume per Month				35					
												
			Labour Hours Required				99.17					
												
			This  simply  means  that  the  business  will  require  99.17  LABOUR HOURS  in  the  MONTH  to  produce									
			the  35  anticipated  units  of  Product.									
												
			NOTE: Those of you  quick  on  the uptake  will realise  another  MAJOR BENEFIT of  a PRODUCT COSTING									
				SYSTEM;  the  ability  it  gives one  to  determine  the  LABOUR REQUIREMENTS  of  the  business								
				ahead of time. All you need  is a  LABOUR STANDARD  and  the  ANTICIPATED VOLUME  for each								
				Product. More about that aspect later.								
- 13 -												
												
			4.4.3.2	CALCULATING THE OVERHEAD RATE PER HOUR								
												
			Once  you have the TOTAL LABOUR HOURS REQUIRED for the MONTH,  it is  a simple  step  to determine									
			the  OVERHEAD  RATE  per  HOUR.									
												
			Overhead for the Month				R 10,000					
			Labour Hours Required				99.17					
												
			Overhead Rate per Hour				R 100.84					
												
			4.4.3.3	INCORPORATING THE OVERHEAD RATE INTO THE OVERALL COST								
												
			Our 2-seater couch, which we have  consistently used as example, now  looks like this in terms of PRODUCT									
			COST,  using  the same format we have used since the beginning and based on LABOUR HOURS:									
												
							Hours	Rate	Cost			
				SALES					R 900.00			
			Less:	DIRECT LABOUR			2.83	R 25.30	R 71.68			
			Less:	DIRECT MATERIAL					R 480.00			
				GROSS PROFIT					R 348.32			
			Less:	OVERHEAD			2.83	R 100.84	R 285.71			
				NET PROFIT					R 62.61			
												
			From the above, you should now be able to notice a number of things: 									
												
			- you now have a FULL PRODUCT COST;									
			- the  COSTING  basically  consists  of  3  COMPONENTS;   DIRECT LABOUR,   DIRECT MATERIALS  and									
			  OVERHEAD;									
			- of these 3 COMPONENTS and  because  it  is  a  LABOUR HOUR-based system,  only  DIRECT LABOUR									
			  and  OVERHEAD  are  calculated  on  a  LABOUR  HOUR  BASE.  MATERIAL,  by  contrast,  is  based  on									
			  the  STANDARD QUANTITIES of MATERIAL  times  the  PRICE OF THE MATERIAL;									
			- the  NET PROFIT  is  basically  ZERO  (rounding prevents it from being),  because  the  COSTING is based									
			  on  BREAKEVEN VOLUME (see 4.4.6).									
												
			4.4.3.4	ONE LAST THING ABOUT OVERHEAD : VARIABLE AND FIXED								
												
			Traditionally  the  OVERHEAD   of  any  business  consists   of  certain  costs   which  are  more  VARIABLE									
			than others. VARIABLE OVERHEAD  is  that  OVERHEAD  which,  from  time to  time,  can  FLUCTUATE  in									
			line with SALES or general business activity. An example of such  OVERHEAD is  INDIRECT WAGES, which									
			often  represents  SUPERVISORS' PAY.  Whilst  one  can  argue  that  it  is  more  FIXED  than  VARIABLE,									
			some  businesses  will   lay  off  supervisors  when   the  activity  levels   in  the  business  are  low.  Or  more									
			simply,  OVERTIME worked  by  a SUPERVISOR  will  definitely  decrease  at  points  of  lower  activity,  as									
			it  will  INCREASE  in BUSIER TIMES. For this reason,  INDIRECT WAGES can  be considered a VARIABLE									
			OVERHEAD.									
												
			The  reason  why  this  distinction  is  important  and why  it is  brought  up here,  is  that  in some  COSTING									
			SYSTEMS, VARIABLE OVERHEAD  will be  added to DIRECT COST  and,  together with  DIRECT LABOUR									
			and DIRECT MATERIAL,  create the GROSS PROFIT. However,  whilst your  COSTING SYSTEM  makes the									
			distinction between the types of OVERHEAD, it only includes LABOUR and MATERIAL under DIRECT COST.									
												
5.		USING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT GROSS PROFIT TO MAKE EFFECTIVE BUSINESS DECISIONS										
												
	5.1	RELATING CALCULATED DIRECT COST TO A PROJECTED SELLING PRICE										
												
			Recapping  the  earlier  discussion, let us  relate the above  to  a  number of  fictitious  SELLING PRICES and									
			see  how  well  we  understand  the  principle  of  GROSS PROFIT %.									
												
				SELLING PRICE		R 800	R 850	R 900	R 950	R 1,000	R 1,100	R 1,200
			Less:	DIRECT COST		R 637	R 637	R 637	R 637	R 637	R 637	R 637
				GROSS PROFIT		R 163	R 213	R 263	R 313	R 363	R 463	R 563
												
				GROSS PROFIT %		20.33%	25.01%	29.18%	32.91%	36.26%	42.06%	46.88%
												
			At a  rough estimate  and  using  GROSS PROFIT %  norms  across industries,  you would  CERTAINLY not									
			want to sell THE PRODUCT for  LESS THAN R950  (G.P.% = 23.51%) and PROBABLY  not  for  less  than 									
			R1,038, which is a G.P.% of 30%.									
- 14 -												
												
			Of  course,  the SELLING PRICE  is  far  less  a  function of  the COST  which  underpins  it  and  far  more  a									
			function  of  WHAT THE MARKET IS PREPARED TO PAY  for  each  Product. If  for  instance,  the  MARKET									
			into which you are selling is prepared  to  pay only  R900 for  the Product,  you will  make  a GROSS PROFIT									
			of  19.26%  on the  Product. This  may or may  not  be  sufficient  to cover  the OVERHEAD  of  your  business.									
												
	5.2	DETERMINING THE BREAKEVEN POINT										
												
			In order to set up an example for MEASURING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT,									
			let us make the following assumptions:									
												
			Obtainable Selling Price				R 900					
			Monthly Overhead				R10000					
												
			At  a  GROSS PROFIT of 19.26%  for  the  Product  and  using  our  knowledge  of  BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS, 									
			it means that  we have to  SELL R51,921  (R10,000 Overhead divide  by  19.26% Gross Profit) of  the  Product									
			in  a  month. That  translates  into  57.69 units  to  be  sold  (R51,921  divide  by  R900  per  unit).									
												
			In summary:									
												
			Breakeven Sales in Value				R51,921					
			Breakeven Sales in Units				57.69					
												
	5.3	APPLYING ANTICIPATED VOLUMES TO DETERMINE VIABILITY										
												
			The  question  that  now  arises  is  WHAT WE  EXPECT  OUR  VOLUMES TO BE  per  month.  Let  us  use 									
			5 different ANTICIPATED VOLUMES, in addition  to the  breakeven volume,  to see  what  the effect  of each 									
			level is going to be.									
												
			Unit Sales			30	40	50	57.69	60	70	
			Selling Price			R 900	R 900	R 900	R 900	R 900	R 900	
												
			Projected Sales Value			R 27,000	R 36,000	R 45,000	R 51,921	R 54,000	R 63,000	
												
			Direct Cost			R 19,122	R 25,496	R 31,870	R 36,771	R 38,244	R 44,618	
												
			Gross Profit			R 7,878	R 10,504	R 13,130	R 15,150	R 15,756	R 18,382	
												
			Overhead			R 10,000	R 10,000	R 10,000	R 10,000	R 10,000	R 10,000	
												
			Net Profit			-R 2,122	R 504	R 3,130	R 5,150	R 5,756	R 8,382	
												
			It  is evident  from  the above  that,  at the  current  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT,  UNIT SALES of  LESS than 									
			60 per  month  will  be  suicidal  for  the  business.									
												
			For the  sake of  what  we are  trying  to achieve, let  us assume  that  we cannot  see  ourselves selling more 									
			than 50 UNITS per month. Thanks to the exact  PRODUCT COSTING,  we know  that we are  on a hiding next									
			to  nothing  should  we  proceed  to  start  selling  the  Product  into  the  market.  So,  what  to  do?									
												
	5.4	USING DIRECT COST DATA TO REVIEW OUR PROCESSES										
												
			Our  Selling Price is "fixed" at R900,  our Overhead is R10,000 per month  and  we  do  not expect  to sell									
			more  than  50 units per month,  which  is  not  sufficient  to  get  us  into  a  profit  situation.									
												
			This situation has arisen because of 4 factors in our business:									
												
			- the SELLING PRICE of R 900;									
			- the VOLUME anticipated of 50 units per month;									
			- the OVERHEAD of R10,000 per month and									
			- the DIRECT COST of R126.76 per Product.									
												
			There  is  not much we  can do  about  the FIRST  2 factors;  they  are largely  EXTERNAL  ones. That  is  not									
			where  we  should  be  focussing  in  the  first  place,  anyway;  our  problem   is  with  OVERHEAD  and  with  									
			DIRECT COST,  either  ONE  or  BOTH  of  these  factors.									
- 15 -												
												
			Let  us  again  assume,  for  the  sake  of  the  exercise,  that  there  is nothing we  can  do  about the level of									
			OVERHEAD. What  we  need  to  do  is  address  the  level  of  our  DIRECT COST, in  other  words REVIEW									
			the  COMPONENTS  of  the  COST   in  order  to  see   whether  we  can   SQUEEZE  OUT  MORE  GROSS 									
			PROFIT.  It is when  this is  required that an INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM  really  comes  into									
			it's  own  to  assist  you  in  making  the  RIGHT ADJUSTMENTS  in  your  business.									
												
			Let  us  go  back  to  our  INITIAL STANDARDS  for  LABOUR  and MATERIAL  and  review what  makes up									
			the  DIRECT COST.									
												
		5.4.1	REVIEWING LABOUR STANDARDS AND RATES									
												
			PRODUCT :		A  2-SEATER  COUCH							
												
				TASK				TASK TIME (mins)			RATE  (per hour)	COST
				Cut Out Wood				55			R 30.00	R 27.50
				Cut Out Sponge				20			R 20.00	R 6.67
				Cut Out Material				35			R 25.00	R 14.58
				Stitch Material				25			R 30.00	R 12.50
				Assemble Wood				20			R 35.00	R 11.67
				Attach Foam				10			R 20.00	R 3.33
				Cover Material				20			R 25.00	R 8.33
				Staple Material				5			R 20.00	R 1.67
				Clean & Check				5			R 40.00	R 3.33
				LABOUR HOURS				195				R 89.58
												
			Each  of  the above  LABOUR STANDARDS  should  be  reviewed  for accuracy. It  may  well  be  that  one or									
			more of  the STANDARDS for  the TASKS are  TOO HIGH,  in  which  case  they  should  be  adjusted  to the									
			correct rate. If you are  not  sure, you can do a TIME STUDY  on the  floor for  the  same or  a  similar product									
			and  adjust  the  STANDARD  accordingly.									
												
			You may  well  ask  how  it is possible  that  one  or  more  of your  LABOUR STANDARDS  are  TOO HIGH. 									
			Any  STANDARD  in  a  business  is  there  to  MEASURE  YOUR  BUSINESS  AGAINST.  Once  set, it also									
			becomes  the  NORM  for  that  particular  action.  It is  therefore  important that, when setting your standards,									
			you  set  them  reasonably  TIGHT -  the  idea  about  a  STANDARD  is  that  it  is  something  that you want
			your staff  to aspire  to. This gives  you the  opportunity  to  "DRIVE"  your  LABOUR  towards the STANDARD
			on  a  daily basis. Typically, people will  introduce an  INCENTIVE SCHEME  based  on  these  communicated
			STANDARDS  and  pay  out   PERFORMANCE  BONUSES   for  STANDARDS  achieved.  That  is  the  really
			exciting  part  of  having  STANDARDS  in  place.  But  more  about  that  later.
			
			For  the  moment,  know  that  your  PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM  will  both  allow  you  and  demand  from 
			you  a   regular  review   of  STANDARDS,   because   they   are  supposed   to   be  TIGHTER than ACTUAL
			PERFORMANCE  traditionally. But  be  aware  that  it  is both senseless and dangerous to ADJUST standards
			merely to make "the numbers work". 
			
			Now, For sake of  the example, let us say  that  the  review reveals that the STANDARDS for 3 of the TASKS, 
			"Cut Out Wood"  (40),   Cut Out Material  (30)  and  Assemble Wood  (15)  need  to  be adjusted. This will
			reduce  the  TOTAL LABOUR HOURS  to  170 minutes.
			
			Let us  further assume  that  a review  of the  LABOUR RATES per TASK  show  that the  applicable  rate for
			"Cut Out Wood" is R25/hour  and that for  "Stitch Material" is also R25/hour.  This may  be  because you									
			have found  another  staff  member  who will  in  future  perform  these  TASKS,  possibly  because  you  have 									
			some  TRAINING  in  the  interim.									
												
			Processing these changes will now deliver the following:									
												
				TASK				TASK TIME (mins)			RATE  (per hour)	COST
				Cut Out Wood				40			R 25.00	R 16.67
				Cut Out Sponge				20			R 20.00	R 6.67
				Cut Out Material				30			R 25.00	R 12.50
				Stitch Material				25			R 25.00	R 10.42
				Assemble Wood				15			R 35.00	R 8.75
				Attach Foam				10			R 20.00	R 3.33
				Cover Material				20			R 25.00	R 8.33
				Staple Material				5			R 20.00	R 1.67
				Clean & Check				5			R 40.00	R 3.33
				LABOUR HOURS				170				R 71.67
- 16 -												
												
			The  ADJUSTMENTS  IN  LABOUR  STANDARDS  and  RATES    REDUCES  the  LABOUR  COST  for  the									
			Product  from  R89.58  to  R71.67.									
												
		5.4.2	REVIEWING MATERIAL STANDARDS AND PRICES									
												
			The same exercise should now be done for MATERIAL STANDARDS and PRICES.									
												
			PRODUCT :		A  2-SEATER  COUCH							
												
				MATERIAL TYPE				MATERIAL QUANTITY			PRICE (per unit)	MATERIALCOST
				Wood				3			R 45.00	R 135.00
				Sponge				4			R 5.00	R 20.00
				Material				4			R 120.00	R 480.00
				Thread				0.5			R 0.50	R 0.25
				Staples				30			R 0.05	R 1.50
												R 636.75
												
			NOTE  that,  of   the  OVERALL  DIRECT  COST  of  R726.62,  MATERIAL  COST  is  R636.75,  which  may 									
			promise  substantial   COST   REDUCTION  upon  review.  This  potential  COST  REDUCTION  may  arise as									
			a result of a number of  factors,  largely  to do  with either  QUANTITY USED  or  PRICE PAID.  The  ACTUAL									
			QUANTITY  USED  per  Product  may  suddenly  be  LESS  THAN  STANDARD,  because  your  awareness									
			of  the  standards  have   prompted  you   to   IMPROVE  your  MONITORING  of   MATERIAL  WASTAGE.									
			Your  awareness  of  the  COST OF MATERIAL  as  part  of  the  TOTAL PRODUCT COST  may  have  even									
			prompted  you  a  while  back  to   introduce   an   INCENTIVE  SCHEME  for  staff  who  cause  the  LEAST									
			WASTAGE of MATERIAL.									
												
			For  sake  of  the  example,  let  us  assume  that,  upon  review, you  realise that the  "Sponge"  required for									
			the  Product  is  actually  3 m  and  the  Material  required  is  3.5.									
												
			In  doing the  review process,  you also  realise that  you are  currently paying  R35 per m for Wood,  instead									
			of  the   previous  standard  of  R45-00 per m.  Or  you  manage  to  negotiate  this  price  with  your  supplier									
			due to the INCREASED OFF-TAKE in the future.									
												
			Processing these changes will now deliver the following:									
												
			PRODUCT :		A  2-SEATER  COUCH							
												
				MATERIAL TYPE				MATERIAL QUANTITY			PRICE (per unit)	MATERIALCOST
				Wood				3			R 35.00	R 105.00
				Sponge				3			R 5.00	R 15.00
				Material				3.5			R 120.00	R 420.00
				Thread				0.5			R 0.50	R 0.25
				Staples				30			R 0.05	R 1.50
												R 541.75
												
			The  concluded  review  REDUCES MATERIAL COST  of  the  Product  from  R636.75  to  R541.75.			
						
			Based on these changes, it means that your TOTAL DIRECT COST is now as follows:			
						
			Direct Labour Cost			R 71.67
			Direct Material Cost			R 541.75
			Total Direct Cost			R 613.42
						
			At a SELLING PRICE of R900, the GROSS PROFIT of the Product is now R286.58. This amounts to a GP%			
			of 31.8% compared to the earlier 19.26%.			
						
			It also means that our  BREAKEVEN SALES required  has  now  REDUCED  to  R31,447  (R10,000 Overhead			
			divide  by  31.8%  GP)  in SALES VALUE  and  to  35 SALES UNITS  per  month. 			
						
			The in-depth review of your PRODUCT COST, which has been  made possible  and relatively easy by virtue			
	D TO MAKE		of  your  PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM,  has   given  you  peace  of  mind  in  taking  on  the  order.  All  you			
			have  to  do  is  ENSURE  ADHERENCE TO YOUR STANDARDS in the future.									
- 17 -												
												
		5.4.3	REVIEWING OVERHEAD COSTS									
												
			Earlier (Section 5.4)  we assumed that  there was  nothing we  could do to our OVERHEAD COST, in order to									
			illustrate  the  process  of  adjusting  either/or  the  DIRECT LABOUR COST  and/or  the  DIRECT MATERIAL  									
			COST. However, there will be instances when the OVERHEAD COST may also be adjustable. It is important									
			to understand that the cost structure of any business is NOT CAST IN STONE and that you may, more often									
			than not, have to review your OVERHEAD COST.									
												
			A review of OVERHEAD COST becomes particularly necessary when a situation such as illustrated in Section									
			5.3 arises,  i.e.when the analysis of  a product's selling price versus it's cost shows that you simply should not									
			take on the product or, more importantly, that you CAN ONLY TAKE ON THE PRODUCT IF, AND ONLY IF,									
			A REVIEW OF STANDARDS AND/OR OVERHEAD COST show that you can.									
												
			To REVIEW OVERHEAD COST, do the following:									
												
			a) PRINT OUT the detailed OVERHEAD COST of your business, as you captured it initially (CLICK on									
			    the YES button in the INPUT MENU next to OVERHEAD COST & GENERAL INPUTS)									
												
			b) REVIEW each OVERHEAD COST for correctness, considering the following:									
												
			    - instances where the particular cost is too low or too high;									
			    - instances where the cost can be REDUCED due to any STRUCTURAL CHANGES you may be able to									
			      make in the business, eg. retrenchment of INDIRECT STAFF, reduction in RENTAL, reduction in									
			      PERSONAL DRAWINGS, review of INSURANCE etc.									
			    - the DELAY PERIOD for any identified changes to materialise in ACTUAL SAVINGS									

			c) once the review process is complete, CAPTURE the changes to OVERHEAD COST into the OVERHEAD									
			   COST & GENERAL INPUTS worksheet and RECALCULATE									

			d) Now check the particular PRODUCT COST in terms of changed COST and G.P.									

6.	BUILDING  YOUR  OWN  PRODUCT  COST, USING YOUR FACT MODEL											
												
	You are now ready to use your PRODUCT COSTING SYSTEM to build your own  PRODUCT COST.											
												
	You will require 6 basic sets of information to complete the set-up process of your Product Costing System. These are:											
												
	- the ANNUAL OVERHEAD COST of the business PER EXPENSE ITEM;											
	- the DIRECT LABOUR TASKS and the LABOUR RATES paid to each individual, either per HOUR, WEEK or MONTH;											
	- the MATERIAL TYPES and PRICE per UNIT;											
	- the PRODUCTS you supply, their SELLING PRICES and the ANTICIPATED VOLUME of SALES per month;											
	- the NUMBER of MINUTES it takes for EACH TASK to be performed for EACH PRODUCT;											
	- the QUANTITY of EACH MATERIAL required for EACH PRODUCT.											
												
	We will deal with each one of these one by one, referring you to each CAPTURING SHEET as we go along.											
			
	It is IMPORTANT TO NOTE that this is something you will only do once, i.e. the SET -UP. Once this process is complete,		
	it will be up to you how often you elect to review and/or change the captured standard data. However, in order to keep your		
	PRODUCT COST as REAL and as ACCURATE as possible in the future and thus derive MAMIMUM BENEFIT therefrom,		
	we recommend the following UPDATE routine:		
			
	- the ANNUAL OVERHEAD COST : ONCE A YEAR, using your Annual Financial Statements as a basis.		
	- the DIRECT LABOUR TASKS : whenever there is a change in personnel.		
	- the DIRECT LABOUR RATES : probably ONCE A YEAR, when the annual wage increases have been completed.		
	- the MATERIAL TYPES : whenever a new material type is brought into production.		
	- the MATERIAL PRICES : whenever a new material type is brought into production and whenever a supplier price changes		
	- the PRODUCTS you supply : whenever a NEW PRODUCT is launched.		
	- the PRODUCT PRICES : whenever you adjust the price of a product on a permanent basis. 		
	- the PRODUCT VOLUMES : ONCE A YEAR, when you budget for the new year, you need to ANTICIPATE sales.		
	- the NUMBER of MINUTES it takes for EACH TASK to be performed for EACH PRODUCT : ONCE A YEAR.		
	- the QUANTITY of EACH MATERIAL required for EACH PRODUCT : ONCE A YEAR.		
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
												
- 18 -												
												
	6.1	CAPTURING OVERHEAD & GENERAL BUSINESS INFO' : MENU ITEM - GENERAL INPUTS										
												
		You need to do the following:										
												
		- Find a summary of ALL the ANNUAL COST of your business										
		  This you will normally find from your bookkeeper or from your own records or from your own "gut-feel".										
			
		- Separate the above into DIRECT COST and OVERHEAD	
		  Remember that ALL COST NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCT is OVERHEAD	
		  NOTE AGAIN that typically ALL COST except DIRECT LABOUR and MATERIAL will be OVERHEAD.	
			
		- Capture these COSTS next to the RELEVANT COST ITEM in the OVERHEAD COST INPUT (Section C)	
			
		- When complete, also CAPTURE the following, also in the GENERAL INPUTS sheet:	
			
			- Section A : the NAME OF YOUR BUSINESS
			- Section B : the NUMBER of the MONTH your FINANCIAL YEAR ends. If you are not sure, enter 2
			- Section D : the HOURS that your business is open PER DAY and the NUMBER of LEAVE DAYS / year
			- Section E : the INCREASES (%) you expect for each item NEXT year and the year AFTER THAT
			- Section F : your  BANK BALANCE  at  the  START of the PERIOD,  the  NUMBER of DAYS  you normally
			                   wait for  your  DEBTORS  to  pay  you  and  the  NUMBER  of  DAYS  you  wait  to  pay  your
			                   CREDITORS.
												
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, YOU ARE DONE WITH THE FIRST SECTION. IF YOU HAVE'NT DONE SO YET, SAVE.										
												
	6.2	CAPTURING PRODUCT DATA : MENU ITEM - PRODUCT TYPES INPUT										
												
		You need to enter the following data relating to your PRODUCTS:										
												
		- The CODE of each PRODUCT: This could either be an INTERNAL CODE you yourself allocated or a CODE 										
		  allocated by a SPECIFIC CUSTOMER										
		- The NAME of each PRODUCT: You want to allocate a name which would assist you in identifying each Product easily										
		- The SELLING PRICE of the PRODUCT : This is your STANDARD Price. If you charge different prices to different										
		  customers, you should rather move to a standard price, with different discounts for different customers.										
		- The PROJECTED (ANTICIPATED) VOLUMES of SALES for each PRODUCT over the NEXT 12 MONTH period.										
												
		NOTE  that one of the strong features of  your  Product Costing System  is  to  allow you  to do  budgeting,  cash flow 										
		projections, determine  labour  and  material requirements and  even  submissions to  institutions  for  possible  future										
		financing  needs.  The  model  thus  provides   a  FUTURE-VIEW,  based  on  CURRENT  and  PAST  STANDARDS.										
												
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, SAVE.										
												
	6.3	CAPTURING LABOUR / PAYROLL DATA : MENU ITEM - PAYROLL INPUT										
												
		You need to enter the following data relating to your DIRECT STAFF:										
												
		- The NAME of each EMPLOYEE										
		- The JOB TITLE of each EMPLOYEE										
		- The Hourly, Weekly or Monthly WAGE RATE you pay each EMPLOYEE, whichever you know best.										
		- The MONTHLY COST to YOU of EACH BENEFIT you pay on behalf of EACH EMPLOYEE										
												
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, SAVE.										
												
		NOTE: These are one of the Worksheets we suggest you PRINT OUT and keep handy.										
												
	6.4	LINKING EMPLOYEES TO EACH OPERATIONAL TASK: MENU ITEM - OPERATIONAL TASKS										
												
		In this worksheet, you need to do 2 things:										

		1. Enter all the OPERATIONAL TASKS on your Production floor, for instance, Saw Wood or Mould Cup. You must list										
		    all of these below each other. NOTE: If you do not know them all, it does not matter, as you will be ADDING SOME										
		    anyway as you go along.										

		2. Use  the  PRINTOUT  of  your  PAYROLL,  suggested  in  6.3,  to  ALLOCATE  each  EMPLOYEE  to  a  specific										
		    OPERATIONAL TASK.  You  do  this  by  capturing  the  relevant  EMPLOYEE NUMBER  next  to  each  TASK.										

		NOTE: Where MORE THAN ONE EMPLOYEE may perform a specific task, you allocate the employee who										
			gets paid the HIGHEST RATE									
- 19 -												

	6.5	CAPTURING LABOUR STANDARDS DATA : MENU ITEM - LABOUR STANDARDS INPUT										
												
		IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE CONTINUING:										
												
		By capturing all the preceding information, you have populated the entire System. In other words, when you soon 										
		proceed to the Labour Standards Input sheet, you will not have to recapture any of the relevant headings again. These										
		headings (for Product, Task Name etc) is now automatically populated.										
												
		The above means that, you need to ONLY enter the following data relating to your LABOUR STANDARDS:										
												
		- the STANDARD TIME (in minutes) for EACH TASK related to EACH PRODUCT.										
												
		PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:										
												
		1. Work from LEFT to RIGHT per PRODUCT, asking yourself:										
		    a) does this Task APPLY to this Product or does this Task need to be PERFORMED in order to produce this										
		        Product?										
		    b) if the answer is NO, you leave the cell BLANK and continue to the next cell;										
		    c) if the answer is YES, you need to ask yourself HOW MANY MINUTES it NORMALLY takes to perform this										
		        Task in making this Product. That value is entered into the cell.										
												
		2. Complete the cells for EACH TASK, for EACH PRODUCT.										
												
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, SAVE.										
												
	6.6	CAPTURING MATERIAL DATA : MENU ITEM - MATERIALS TYPES INPUT										
												
		You need to enter the following data relating to your DIRECT MATERIALS:										
												
		- The NAME of each MATERIAL ITEM										
		- The PRICE per UNIT for each MATERIAL ITEM										
												
		NOTE : Although the UNIT OF MEASURE is optional (for example, "m" for metre or "sq m" for square metre, we										
		recommend you enter it, as it will appear throughout the rest of the system and is a handy tool.										
												
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, SAVE.										


	6.7	CAPTURING MATERIAL STANDARDS DATA : MENU ITEM - MATERIAL STANDARDS INPUT										
												
		NOTE AGAIN before you start that the System has automatically updated all your Product Names and 										
		Material Names and Units of Measure. You only need to capture your Material Standards per Product.										
												
		The above means that, you need to ONLY enter the following data relating to your MATERIAL STANDARDS:										
												
		- the STANDARD AMOUNT OF MATERIAL (in the relevant Unit of Measure) for EACH MATERIAL related to										
		  EACH PRODUCT, eg if the Product takes 2 metres of cloth, you enter 2 NEXT to the Product and BELOW										
		  the Heading "Cloth".										
		
		PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:
		
		1. Work from LEFT to RIGHT per PRODUCT, asking yourself:
		    a) does this Material Item GO INTO this Product
		    b) if the answer is NO, you leave the cell BLANK and continue to the next cell;
		    c) if the answer is YES, you need to ask yourself HOW MANY UNITS of the MATERIAL NORMALLY goes into
		        the Product. That value is entered into the cell.
		
		2. Complete the cells for EACH MATERIAL ITEM, for EACH PRODUCT.
		
		WHEN YOU ARE DONE, SAVE.
		
		YOUR INPUTS ARE NOW COMPLETE. YOU MAY NOW LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF WHAT YOU HAVE
		CAPTURED AND HOW THE SYSTEM HAS USED THE DATA TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE FOLLOWING:

		NOTE :	ALL THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE BY GOING TO THE OUTPUTS MENU

			To access the above, go to the QUOTES MENU and use the HELP function									


7.		CAPTURING ACTUAL PRODUCTION DATA										

		A  Product  Costing  system  is  usually  based on  STANDARDS,  i.e.  LABOUR  and  MATERIAL  STANDARDS  at 										
		STANDARD RATES  and  PRICES. However,  it also useful to build up your own HISTORY of PRODUCTS, especially										
		if  your  business  experiences  frequent  REPEAT  ORDERS.  Not  only does  it provide  a  USEFUL BACKUP to the										
		COST of PRODUCT  and  it's GROSS PROFIT  derived  from your STANDARDS, but  it will very often SPEED UP the										
		CHECKING of an ORDER.										

		MORE IMPORTANTLY, it will enable you to measure your ACTUAL HOURS used against WHAT YOUR										
		STANDARDS say YOU SHOULD HAVE USED. The result of this comparison is your LABOUR EFFICIENCY or										
		UTILIZATION.										

		Among other things, knowing this (PER OPERATIONAL TASK) will mean you could:										

		1.	Address Labour Inefficiency per Task or per Department									
		2.	Cost your Products more accurately by considering the Labour Inefficiency									
		3.	Implement a Performance-based Incentive scheme based on your Production performance against standard.									

	7.1	RECORDING ACTUAL PRODUCTION FIGURES										

		Production  performance is  based on  two measurements; the OUTPUT per product and the TIME it took to produce.
		A simple JOB CARD SYSTEM  will do  this  measurement  for  you,  whereafter  the  information  generated  from  the
		system can be entered into  the FACT Model. The system should be card-based (a card is written out for each Product
		and attached to the Product until it leaves Despatch. The card should reflect the following:

		a) Product Name and/or Code
		b) Column 1 heading : Name of Employee
		c) Column 2 heading : Operational Task
		d) Column 3 heading : Time Started with Operational Task
		e) Column 4 heading : Time Ended with Operational Task
		f) Column 5 heading : Time Expended for each Operational Task

		The Admin Office will issue a Job Card with the Product Name and/or Code at the top when the Product commences
		Production. The Employee completes Columns 1 to 4 throughout the Production process. The Admin Office receives
		back the Job Card at the end of the Production process, casts the different times for each Task and TOTALS the
		Job Card.
